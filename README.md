## notes

- the Candy Crush JS project is designed to work on PC only.
- the Oron's Game JS project presents questions that their answers may include the sign -. In many smartphones the number-keyboard doesn't include this sign, which may cause difficulties to the user. It is recommended to be played on a PC.
